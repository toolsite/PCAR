PSCAD Auto Run (PCAR) Tool by Xiaoyu (Shawn) Wang

Dear users,

I heartedly appreciate your interest in the PCAR tool and providing valuable feedback and comments on using the tool during the past few years. The tool has been updated, trying to address your needs in performing PSCAD MQTs, e.g. removing the prerequisites of IVF12 or Enerplot. The tool has been located in a new home to better serve you in the future. Feel free to reach out to me via the new site (www.NuEnEra.com), if you need any further assistance.

Thanks, Xiaoyu (Shawn)
